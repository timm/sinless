waht does testing mean?

what did it used to mean?

- 100% certification (imposible, run tume, also what is your oralce of a based test?  and it tests fail, what is your cost malde for handling those errors?)
- test-drive developemnt. tried it. didn't work. scalabiltiy. goodl 13 billions tests. tdd failrues at tse
- testing as abcution. never scaled. all those subsets

  decdes laer we know aot more about how to  process large data sets. if we relax "conssntcy" and treat clustering as a kind of soft probailsitic consistency, then scaling gets much easier.

what might it eman:

- confidence that you can do other thigns cause this thing won't hurt you
- joint explroation of a sapce with an au. what does that explore eman?
- community-level testing (support for ethical opoerators)
-t estign as structured argument

short cuts tot esting
- keys, the shorter papre
