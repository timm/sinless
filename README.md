#  Sinless software engineering

When lawyers and politicians cannot keep up with technical innovations, it is up to us technologists to deliberately sin less.  When  we might not be able to aways avoid undesirable  social effects of our technology, we should at least try to write software that sins less, whenever it can. 

 This subject treats ethics as an AI-based optimization problem where software makes  choices that at least monitors, and at most improves, the ethical impact of software. Topics covered will include ethics, case studies in ethical software, international standard for ethics in AI and software engineering, safety engineering, data mining, pareto optimization, multi-objective optimization,   bayesian parameter optimization, discretization, explanation, planning,. 

Projects will be determined by student background: skilled programmers will build AI tools that make better ethical choice; other students will do extensive case studies in ethics and software engineering. 

# what is this subect about

AI, with symbols.

AI, a lighter, learner approach.
learning when enough is enough. Seek summaries of data, not endless 
streams of irrelevant detail.
"We believe that ethical technology is technology
that works for you," said Cook. "It's technology that helps you
sleep, not keeps you up. It tells you when you've had enough. It
gives you space to create or draw or write or learn, not refresh
just one more time."

do not offer clean up for 
the mess they make. remember, the cat in the hat dis disrupt, but hw also had a

## lecture1: u r, u should, u can

this subject is about an unproven idea, based on
proven technology taht very few people know about

if i get this right, i will, at most, show you a new kind
of AI, one where humans and AI can team up and one
can audit, critique and improve the other.

at the very least you'll become expert at AI programming
and gain a sophisticate understanding of issues relating to
ethics and ai

and this is certaininly the  time to try and be an expert in these choice-driven technologies (see 'governement by algorothm')

also, there is movment in the marketplace suggesting that experts in this  area could have a solid career:
The report evaluates DSML platformsâ€™ scope, revenue and growth,
customer counts, market traction, and product capability scoring.
Here are some of the notable findings:

Responsible AI governance, transparency, and addressing model-based
biases are the most valuable differentiators in this market, and
every listed vendor is making progress in these areas.


## details
no exam, no mid-term

week1: hello

week  2-9- homeworls
8 one-week homeworks

week 10 to  13:
one month-long project where you build an argument environment
where humans can dispute and change the decision from an AI

week 15: an exam with 2 parts/

a take home exam two parts (and feel free to do all thework before hand)
1. is ethics just an algorthmic issue?  (3-4 apges, 10 point 2 column)

final exam: take home. 24 hours to  complete
1-3 pages.
3. design a syllabus for this subject.  include comments o algorithma nd non-algorithm aprpoaches, list open issues
in the area. list the kinds of areas this sibject should cover to address those issues. extra marks for those that
go far afield and list methods not discussed (or only partially discussed) in this subejct. offer a lesson  plan 
showing week by week how kong we shiuld talk to what. describe (at a hgih level) the himes and projects wyou wiul set for this
subject.

report 1 due anytime after 1 month in. report2 due at end of

## u should

ethical repsonsibility

Public outcry . Thanod

## u can

u have more choices that you know. "youve given me too many knobs".  so many models.a billlion options mysql . power and throughout and control.  build ocn crweitra C1,c,2 c3, soetne of c4 c5 c6 (random number choice if we actually successed on thos). so many choices.

success of human race, engienering, science, medicine is that the world can be approximated by a small number of lower dimensional ranges and these ranges occur at different frequencies in deisred and undersited cases. these are they keys, find them, use them, control the world (and if you don't someone else will. have u someone else? is that a good idea to leave the world to them?)

# Exercise for week1

1. here;s my definition of ethical: humans can interact understand and change a system. made easier by keys. what missing from that definition? what kind of ethical problems are mssing in the above? for the missing bits, as a comptuer scientist, howmight you address those isses (using insights from algorithms, and insights from data). what could you implement to test that?
2. what about deep learning? is all that antithetical to the above? or is that a way to find the features and structures that make all the above more possible? what could you implement to test that?
3. I kep saying "what coud you implement?". Is this "comptuational view" missing the point? are their improtant ethical issues that are missed if we only study what we can implement?
