"A saint is not someone who never sins, but one who sins less and less 
frequently and gets up more and more quickly."<br>
â€• St. Bernard of Clairvaux


Here are some AI sins, and their potential cure:
-  If AI
generated models are too complex to understand, using symbolic
methods to find regions where conclusions hold. 
- If the AI
need too much data, use semi-supervised learning to reduce
that commissioning cost. 
- If the AI tools are needlessly
complicated, use epsilon domination to stop needlessly explore
spurious details. 
- If the AI tools need tuning, use the above
to tune the models.
