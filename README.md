#  Sinless software engineering

When lawyers and politicians cannot keep up with technical innovations, it is up to us technologists to deliberately sin less.  When  we might not be able to aways avoid undesirable  social effects of our technology, we should at least try to write software that sins less, whenever it can. 

 This subject treats ethics as an AI-based optimization problem where software makes  choices that at least monitors, and at most improves, the ethical impact of software. Topics covered will include ethics, case studies in ethical software, international standard for ethics in AI and software engineering, safety engineering, data mining, pareto optimization, multi-objective optimization,   bayesian parameter optimization, discretization, explanation, planning,. 

Projects will be determined by student background: skilled programmers will build AI tools that make better ethical choice; other students will do extensive case studies in ethics and software engineering. 

## lecture1: u r, u should, u can

this subject is about an unproven idea, based on
proven technology taht very few people know about

if i get this right, i will, at most, show you a new kind
of AI, one where humans and AI can team up and one
can audit, critique and improve the other.

at the very least you'll become expert at AI programming
and gain a sophisticate understanding of issues relating to
ethics and ai

no exam, no mid-term

8 one-week homeworks
one month-long project where you build an argument environment
where humans can dispute and change the decision from an AI

finally, two small reports : 

1. is ethics just an algorthmic issue?  
2. design a syllabus for this subject. 

report 1 due anytime after 1 month in. report2 due at end of
terms

ur invoved in ethical decions,  perputating certain curent  social structures, dismepowering certain groups. u have for years. nobel change within change. facebook etc.

- attention economy
- /the social network

## u should

ethical repsonsibility

Public outcry . Thanod

## u can

u have more choices that you know. "youve given me too many knobs".  so many models.a billlion options mysql . power and throughout and control.  build ocn crweitra C1,c,2 c3, soetne of c4 c5 c6 (random number choice if we actually successed on thos). so many choices.

success of human race, engienering, science, medicine is that the world can be approximated by a small number of lower dimensional ranges and these ranges occur at different frequencies in deisred and undersited cases. these are they keys, find them, use them, control the world (and if you don't someone else will. have u someone else? is that a good idea to leave the world to them?)

# Exercise for week1

1. here;s my definition of ethical: humans can interact understand and change a system. made easier by keys. what missing from that definition? what kind of ethical problems are mssing in the above? for the missing bits, as a comptuer scientist, howmight you address those isses (using insights from algorithms, and insights from data). what could you implement to test that?
2. what about deep learning? is all that antithetical to the above? or is that a way to find the features and structures that make all the above more possible? what could you implement to test that?
3. I kep saying "what coud you implement?". Is this "comptuational view" missing the point? are their improtant ethical issues that are missed if we only study what we can implement?
