rules

- DIY: dont trust what i say, do it for your self
- LIM: less is more
- many dimensions can be approxived by just a few ranges
- those ranges cocur att different frequencies in desired and undesired goals
- simple to build tools taht learn what combinations range are most advangageus or dangerous
- sample stochastically to find the keys, explore combos of the keys
- if you cant sn zero then at least sin less
- ethics: u are, u shoiuld, u cam
- dont grow on S1 then eval on S2 
- start as tyou eman to go on. if evaling using SE then grow w=using SE
- there is no best eval criteria.
- comptuers are stupodm then only give you naswers
- the only good answer is the one that destroys the question
- hold hands with AI, walk the world together
- best or rest, nothing lese matters.
-  bias makes us blidn, bias lets us see
- use bias
- document bias
- sample across saplce of bias
- cut the crap, use what's left
- baseline taccitic: assume keys see how far you go
- use volumes, not point
- random projtions, not raw data
- better better better: if improvement seem then etter better is expontially smaller. so dont stop till you find better to least 4 times
- cluster before doing stats
- use stats less
- stochastics for scalbikity
