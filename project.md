# Project

Write two AI tools that incrementally updates a model after asking some oracle for an pinon
(about something). Allow a human to revisit and change old decisions then replay all the processing
from that decision, coming forwards (perhaps asking humans new information as it does so).

AI tool0 is some baseline in the literature.  justify yur selection of that ool via  quick review o fthe field:

- starting with papers listed i Googe Scholar Metrics
- working backwatds ten years
- focuisng on papers with (x+10/(y+1E-31)) > 10 citations (weere x is number of cotations and y is years
  since publcation). so x> 10*(y -1 ) So any paper i the last year (y-=0)is fine. A paper that is
  2 years old needs at least 1 citatoipns. a aper that is 5 years old needs at least 40 citations
  and a paper that is 10 eyars old needs at least 90 citations.
- your lit review of that work (less than 2 pages long) has to respect and disrepset most of that  work. list
what it is, why it was deeemd successful by its original authors, then say why you are not using it.
finally, one (or two) examples from that prior work will be your reference system tool0 that you will have to implement.

AI tool1 is your own idea. Justified by the same lit review.

Note that before you recomemd technology for tool0, tool1, 

as for assessemnt:

- runtime
- number of times the system puases to ask the user a question
- sizse of the uestion (number of aov tripples (attibute objevt value))
noice sesnisity: add in random number genrato to the conclusions you get from your oracle

- human experiments.
